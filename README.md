# Daraz-Spider-Django
#### Django web application to get the best deals from Daraz. By saying best deals, I have mentioned those products that have maximum reduction in price by time. Will get Carousels of products.
#### Products: Headphones, Smart Watches, Keyborads, Mice and Spectacles.

## Landing page
#### Here it will take 20 - 40 seconds to scrap the website by makeing fake ajax calls.

## Home page

## Product by brand
#### Every Carousels has some tags bellow the section headings (e.g. Headphones) and we can get more products by using those tags.
#### These tags are basically brands and dealers.
